## Introduction

Variables are instrumental in programming because they are used as "containers" to store data values. To assign a value to a variable, we can use `<−` or `=`. However, most R users prefer to `<−`.

Examples of variable assignment

```{r}
variable_1 <- 5
variable_1
```

```{r}
variable_2 = 10
variable_2
```

```{r}
15 -> variable_3
variable_3
```

```{r}
variable_4 <- variable_5 <- 30
variable_4
variable_5
```

The output of the variable can then be obtained by:

1.  Typing the variable name and then pressing "Enter,"
2.  Typing "print" with the variable name in brackets, print(variable), and
3.  Type "View" with the variable name in brackets, View(variable).

Both print() and View() are some of the many built-in functions[^1] available in R.

[^1]: Functions are a collection of statements (organized and reusable code) that perform a specific task, and R has many built-in functions.

In RStudio, the list of variables that have been loaded can be viewed in the environment pane.

A screenshot of the environment pane with the stored variables.

```{r}
print(variable_1)
```

```{r}
View(variable_2)
```

Output of view will be seen in the text editor

## The assign() and rm() functions

In addition to using the assignment operators, we can use the assign() function to assign a value to a variable.

```{r}
assign("variable_6", 555)
variable_6
```

To remove the assignment of the value to the variable, either delete the variable in the "environment pane" or use the rm() function.

```{r}
variable_7 <- 159
```

```{r}
rm(variable_7)
```

View the environment pane to confirm whether `variable_7` has been removed.

## Naming variables

You may be wondering what rules are used for naming variables. First, we need to give the variables meaningful names such as current_temp, time_24_hr, or weight_lbs. However, we need to be mindful of the (variable style guide) which provides us with the appropriate conventions for naming variables.

Some rules to keep in mind are:

1.  R is case-sensitive (variable is not the same as Variable),
2.  Names similar to typical outputs or functions (TRUE, FALSE, if, or else) cannot be used,
3.  Appropriate variable names can contain letters, numbers, dots, and underscores. However, you cannot start with an underscore, number, or dot followed by a number.

## Examples of valid and invalid names

**Valid names**
- time_24_hr
- .time24_hr

**Invalid names** 
- _24_hr.time
- 24_hr_time
- .24_hr_time
