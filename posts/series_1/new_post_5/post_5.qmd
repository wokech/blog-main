## Introduction

R has many different types of operators that can perform different tasks. Here we will focus on 5 major types of operators. The major types of operators are:

1.  Arithmetic,

2.  Relational,

3.  Logical,

4.  Assignment, and

5.  Miscellaneous.

### 1. Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations. These operators have been highlighted in [Part 1](/posts/series_1/new_post_2/post_2.html) of the series.

### 2. Relational Operators

Relational operators are used to find the relationship between 2 variables and compare objects. The output of these comparisons is Boolean (`TRUE` or `FALSE`). The table below describes the most common relational operators.

| Relational Operator |       Description        |
|:-------------------:|:------------------------:|
|         \<          |        Less than         |
|         \>          |       Greater than       |
|         \<=         |  Less than or equal to   |
|         \>=         | Greater than or equal to |
|         ==          |         Equal to         |
|         !=          |       Not Equal to       |

### Examples

```{r}
x <- 227
y <- 639
```

Less than

```{r}
x<y
```

Greater than

```{r}
x>y
```

Less than or equal to

```{r}
x <= 300
```

Greater than or equal to

```{r}
y >= 700
```

Equal to

```{r}
y == 639
```

Not Equal to

```{r}
x != 227
```

### 3. Logical Operators

Logical operators are used to specify multiple conditions between objects. Logical operators work with basic data types such as logical, numeric, and complex data types. This returns `TRUE` or `FALSE` values. Numbers greater that `1` are `TRUE` and `0` equals `FALSE`. The table below describes the most common logical operators.

| Logical Operator |       Description        |
|:----------------:|:------------------------:|
|        !         |       Logical NOT        |
|        \|        | Element-wise logical OR  |
|       \|\|       |        Logical OR        |
|        &         | Element-wise logical AND |
|        &&        |       Logical AND        |

### Examples

```{r}
vector_1 <- c(0,2)
vector_2 <- c(1,0)
```

Logical NOT

```{r}
!vector_1
!vector_2
```

Logical OR

```{r}
vector_1 | vector_2
```

Logical AND

```{r}
vector_1 & vector_2
```

Element-wise logical OR

```{r}
vector_1 || vector_2
```

Element-wise logical AND

```{r}
vector_1 && vector_2
```

### 4. Assignment Operators

These operators assign values to variables. A more comprehensive review can be obtained in [Part 2](/posts/series_1/new_post_3/post_3.html) of the series.

### 5. Miscellaneous Operators

These are helpful operators for working in that can perform a variety of functions. A few common miscellaneous operators are described below.

| Miscellaneous Operator |                          Description                           |
|:----------------------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------:|
|          %\*%          | Matrix multiplication (to be discussed in subsequent chapters) |
|          %in%          |               Does an element belong to a vector               |
|           :            |                      Generate a sequence                       |

### Examples

Sequence

```{r}
a <- 1:8
b <- 4:10
```

Element in a vector

```{r}
a %in% b
9 %in% b
9 %in% a

```
