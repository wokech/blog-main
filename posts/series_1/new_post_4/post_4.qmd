## Introduction

R and RStudio utilize very many data types to store different kinds of data. The most common data types in R are listed below.

| **Data Type** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                           |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Numeric       | The most common data type. The values can be numbers or decimals (all real numbers).                                                                                                      |
| Integer       | Special case of numeric data without decimals.                                                                                                                                            |
| Logical       | Boolean data type with only 2 values (`TRUE` or `FALSE`).                                                                                                                                 |
| Complex       | Specifies imaginary values in R.                                                                                                                                                          |
| Character     | Assigns a character or string to a variable. The character variables are enclosed in single quotes ('character') while the string variables are enclosed in double quotes ("string").     |
| Factor        | Special type of character variable that represents a categorical such as gender.                                                                                                          |
| Raw           | Specifies values as raw bytes. It uses built-in functions to convert between raw and character (charToRaw() or rawToChar()).                                                              |
| Dates         | Specifies the date variable. Date stores a date and POSIXct stores a date and time. The output is indicated as the number of days (Date) or number of seconds (POSIXct) since 01/01/1970. |

## Data Type Examples

**Numeric**

```{r}
89.98

55
```

**Integer**

```{r}
5L

5768L
```

**Logical**

```{r}
TRUE

FALSE
```

**Complex**

```{r}
10 + 30i

287 + 34i
```

**Character or String**

```{r}
'abc'

"def"

"I like learning R"
```

**Dates**

```{r}
"2022-06-23 14:39:21 EAT"

"2022-06-23"
```

## Examining data types

Several functions exist to examine the features of the various data types. These include:

1.  `typeof()` -- what is the data type of the object (low-level)?
2.  `class()` -- what is the data type of the object (high-level)?
3.  `length()` -- how long is the object?
4.  `attributes()` -- any metadata available?

Let's look at how these functions work with a few examples

```{r}
a <- 45.84
b <- 858L
c <- TRUE
d <- 89 + 34i
e <- 'abc'
```

Examine the data type at a low-level with `typeof()`

```{r}
typeof(a)
typeof(b)
typeof(c)
typeof(d)
typeof(e)
```

Examine the data type at a high-level with `class()`

```{r}
class(a)
class(b)
class(c)
class(d)
class(e)
```

To test whether the variable is of a specific type, we can use the "is.\_\_\_()" functions.

First, we test the variable `a` which is numeric.

```{r}
is.numeric(a)
is.integer(a)
is.logical(a)
is.character(a)
```

Second, we test the variable `c` which is logical.

```{r}
is.numeric(c)
is.integer(c)
is.logical(c)
is.character(c)
```

To convert between data types we can use the "as.\_\_\_()" functions. These include: `as.Date()`, `as.numeric()`, and `as.factor()`. Additionally, other helpful functions include factor() which adds levels to the data and nchar() which provides the length of the data.

Examples

```{r}
as.integer(a)
as.logical(0)
as.logical(1)
nchar(e)
```
