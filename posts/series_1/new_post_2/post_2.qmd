## Introduction

This is the first in a series of blog posts looking at the basics of R and RStudio. These programs allow us to perform various basic and complex calculations. To get started, first, we will open R or RStudio. In R, go to the console, and in RStudio, head to the console pane. Next, type in a basic arithmetic calculation such as "1 + 1" after the angle bracket (\>) and hit "Enter."

An example of a basic calculation:

```{r}
1+1
```

The output will be observed next to the square bracket containing the number 1 (\[1\]).

## What arithmetic operators are available in R/RStudio?

Various arithmetic operators (listed below) can be used in R/RStudio.

| Arithmetic Operator |            Description             |
|:-------------------:|:----------------------------------:|
|         \+          |              Addition              |
|         \-          |            Subtraction             |
|         \*          |           Multiplication           |
|          /          |              Division              |
|     \*\* or \^      |           Exponentiation           |
|         %%          | Modulus (remainder after division) |
|         %/%         |          Integer division          |

## Examples

Addition

```{r}
10+30
```

Subtraction

```{r}
30-24
```

Multiplication

```{r}
20*4
```

Division

```{r}
93/4
```

Exponentiation

```{r}
3^6
```

Modulus (remainder with division)

```{r}
94%%5
```

Integer Division

```{r}
54%/%7
```

Slightly more complex arithmetic operations

```{r}
5-1+(4*3)/16*3
```

## Summary

After going through this post, I hope that you can now perform simple arithmetic calculations in R/RStudio.
