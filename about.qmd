Hello! My name is William Okech, and I am a research scientist from Kenya.

My PhD is in Biomedical Engineering, and I'm interested in data visualization and developing interactive dashboards using R and Python.

Additionally, I'm a \[Carpentry Instructor\](https://carpentries.org/instructors/) and I intend to use this blog to introduce readers to the basics of R and Python.
