# Information Processing Theory and Cognitive Load

## 1. Information Processing Theory

-   A framework for understanding how information is encoded into memory

:::

## 2. Cognitive Load

-   Available amount of information that the working / short-term memory can hold at a specific time (7 +/- 2 chunks of info at a time)

## 3. Cognitive Load Theory

### Intrinsic

-   Innate difficulty of a task and complexity of new information.

-   Influenced by age and/or educational background.

:::

## 3. Cognitive Load Theory

### Extraneous

-   Load due to poorly designed instructional material.

-   Distracts working memory from processing the required information.

## 3. Cognitive Load Theory

### Germane

-   Mental capacity used to integrate new information with existing knowledge

-   Effort required to learn and retain the material

-   Influenced by level of training (Math Professor vs 1st grader)

# Part II: Cognitive Load Theory and Course Design

## 1. Identify Learner Personas / Types

-   **Learners can be distinguished by the mental models they use to solve problem.**

## 2. Mental models

-   **"A simplified representation of the most important parts of some problem domain that is good enough to enable problem solving."**

![](min_cog_overload_images/ball_stick.png){.absolute top="200" left="750" width="450" height="450"}

-   **Limitations**

    -   Simplified representation.
    -   Atoms are not balls
    -   Sticks are not bonds.

## 3. Formative Assessments

:::

**Help to identify common misconceptions and broken mental models.**

a.  **Factual errors**: The Capital City of Sweden is Doha.

b.  **Broken models**: Motion and acceleration must always be in the same direction.

c.  **Fundamental beliefs**: Some people are computational and others are not.

## 3. Formative Assessments

**Example**

![](min_cog_overload_images/form_assess.png)

**Each incorrect answer has diagnostic power and will guide correction**

## 4. Improving course content and delivery

**Encourage the use of concept maps**

Example Discussion: Renewable and Non-renewable Energy Sources

:::

## 4. Improving course content and delivery

-   Go slow and repeat if necessary
-   Be aware of expert blind spots
-   Use authentic tasks and examples to teach
-   Give and receive appropriate feedback

## Conclusions

-   Cognitive load and working / short-term memory have a significant impact on learning outcomes.
-   Knowledge of learner types and personas and the mental models they use is critical for effective teaching.
-   Formative assessments should be incorporated into lessons to identify misconceptions and receive teaching feedback.

## Discussion Questions

-   Where have you identified "expert blind spots" in your own teaching?
-   How can you reduce cognitive overload in the subjects that you teach?
-   Based on what you have learnt, how will you structure your courses differently?
