## Importance of Computational Research Skills

**What computational research skills are important?**

-   This can be determined with a needs analysis using:
    -   Surveys and Questionnaires sent to humanities departments,
    -   Literature reviews focused on computing education research,
    -   Interviews with faculty and staff from humanities departments.

## Summary

-   Computational research skills are essential for everyone.
-   Humanities students can greatly benefit from computational research skills by:
    -   Exploring new research directions, and,
    -   Increasing their employment options.

1.  Workshops - where the most common computational tasks and the needs identified by graduate students are taught.
2.  Office hours - supervised by an undergraduate/graduate student with a background in computational research.

## Effective teaching of computational research skills

**What activities should the instruction program focus on?**

3.  Mentoring - pair humanities graduate students with computational science students.
4.  Bootcamps - focused on specific data analysis tools/programs.
5.  Journal/Data clubs - where new and relevant tools, techniques, and software packages will be demonstrated.

## Effective teaching of computational research skills

-   A number of independent initiatives exist to train the general public in basic data and computational skills. These include:

## Effective teaching of computational research skills

**What should novice coders learn? (My personal opinion)**

-   Scratch (block-based visual programming language) for complete novices.
-   Help new coders learn the basics of programming, such as loops, conditionals, and variables.

# Challenges associated with teaching computational research skills

## Challenges associated with teaching computational research skills

**Barriers to overcome include:**

-   Attitudes towards coding.
-   The variety of needs (even within humanities):
    -   Example: Psychology vs Literature.
-   Over-reliance on no-code commercially available tools and a lack of willingness to change.

## Challenges associated with teaching computational research skills

**What students should avoid:**

-   Learning too much at once without mastering the basics.
-   Continuously working on tutorials but not applying knowledge to personal projects.
-   Copy-and-pasting code rather than understanding why the code was used.
-   Learning multiple tools/programs simultaneously (such as Python, R, and Javascript).

# Conclusions

## Conclusions

-   Computational thinking is for everyone.
-   Computational research skills can be very helpful for humanities students.
-   Various initiatives such as the Carpentries and CodeRefinery have devised effective blueprints for teaching.

## Conclusions

-   Novices should consider starting with visual block-based programming.
-   There is a need to teach students effective learning practices and overcome the barriers to coding.
-   Teaching should be adapted to different student abilities and should include motivational feedback.
