::: {#hero-heading}
I am a research scientist and scientific editor from Kenya.

My PhD is in Biomedical Engineering, and I'm interested in data visualization (R/RStudio) and developing interactive dashboards (Shiny).

Additionally, I'm a [Carpentry Instructor](https://carpentries.org/instructors/) and I intend to use this blog to introduce readers to the basics of data analysis and visualization.
