::: {#hero-heading style="text-align:left"}
I am a research scientist, science editor, and data literacy trainer ([here](https://digital-research.academy/trainers/WilliamOkech/) and [here](https://carpentries.org/instructors/)) with a background in Biomedical Engineering. My primary interests include:

• Biotechnology and Bioengineering

• Data Visualization (See samples of my work [here](portfolio/soc_med.qmd))

In the [**blog**](blog.qmd) section, I hope to introduce readers to the basics of data analysis and visualization, and provide a periodic summary of recent advances in biotechnology and bioengineering.

Additionally, the portfolio section showcases some of my [**projects**](portfolio/apps.qmd) and work on [**social media**](portfolio/soc_med.qmd).

Lastly, the resources section offers a list of curated website links that address a wide variety of topics in STEM.
