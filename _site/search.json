Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda were the founding members in 1967 before the organization dissolved in 1977. The organization was re-established in the year 2000, and new members were accepted in subsequent years: Burundi and Rwanda (2009), South Sudan (2016), Democratic Republic of the Congo (2022), and Somalia (2023).\nIn this post, I will use ggforce and geom_voronoi_tile() to generate Voronoi diagrams depicting the flags of the East African Community.\nThis work is inspired by Albert Rapp’s blog post, where he provides examples of the use of ggforce."

However, we need to be mindful of the variable style guide which provides us with the appropriate rules for naming variables.\nSome rules to keep in mind are:\n\nR is case-sensitive (variable is not the same as Variable),\nNames similar to typical outputs or functions (TRUE, FALSE, if, or else) cannot be used,\nAppropriate variable names can contain letters, numbers, dots, and underscores. However, you cannot start with an underscore, number, or dot followed by a number."

    "text": "In January 2018, former President Uhuru Kenyatta announced the creation of the Chief Administrative Secretary (CAS) position. The primary role of the appointees would be to “help the Cabinet Secretary to better coordinate the running of the affairs of the respective ministries 1.” Though highly controversial at the time (as civil society groups 2 challenged the legality of the position), the High Court (in February 2023) eventually ruled that the decision to create the new position was lawful 3.\nThe Public Service Commission (PSC) of Kenya is responsible for government recruitment, and Section 234 of the Constitution of Kenya states that part of its mandate includes the “establishment of public offices” and “appointment of persons to those offices.” The most recent call for applications to the CAS position was circulated in October 2022 4. Here, the PSC listed the roles, responsibilities, and requirements for all applicants. To ensure transparency in the recruitment process, the PSC provided a list of all the applicants 5, the shortlisted applicants [5], and a schedule of the interview times [5]. After the interview, the names of successful candidates were forwarded to the President for appointment. On March 16th, 2023, President William Ruto appointed fifty (50) individuals to the CAS position, which was more than double the number of positions created by the PSC. The legality of these appointments has already been challenged in court and we await the final verdict 6 7.\nControversy aside, the goal of this article is to provide a data-driven assessment of publicly available recruitment information (specifically gender, disability status, and county of origin) to determine whether principles of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) were promoted during the hiring process."

    "title": "Exploring gender distributions in Kenya: Are there more women than men?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "To answer this question, I reviewed the Kenya Population and Housing Census (2019)12 report, which provides data on population by sex and age at the county and subcounty levels. This analysis was inspired by Rose Mintzer-Sweeney’s article “Sex and the Census,” published on the Datawrapper website 3.\nVarious biological, cultural, public health, and economic factors can influence the global human sex ratio. For instance, at birth, the human sex ratio is “male-biased,” with approximately 105 males born per 100 girls. However, with increasing age, the susceptibility to infectious diseases, sex-selective abortions, and higher life expectancies for women can cause fluctuations in the human sex ratio4. The total Kenyan population in 2019 (according to the census) was 47,564,296. When I compared the number of males to females at the national level (Figure 1), I found that there were 98 males for every 100 females in the country5.\nFigure 1: At the national level, there are more females compared with males\nKnowing there were more females than males, I sought to determine whether these differences persisted across all age groups (Figure 2).\nFigure 2: There are more males than females between 0–19 yrs and between 36–58 yrs.\nAs expected, I observed a higher number of males compared with females between 0 to 18 years. One reason could be the higher male-to-female ratio seen at birth globally6. Between the ages of 19 to 34 years, the male-to-female ratio decreases rapidly, while from 35 to 56 years, the ratio increases rapidly. The cause of this fluctuation is not apparent, but various public health factors may be responsible for the shifts observed within these age groups. Finally, the number of males compared with females steadily decreases after age 60. One reason for this could be the prevalence of medical conditions that disproportionately affect men. Additionally, the decrease in the number of males to females could result from increases in life expectancy favoring women, as demonstrated by the Economic Survey 2022, which shows that the male life expectancy is 60.6 vs. 66.5 for females7.\nBy focusing on the national human sex ratio, we may assume that the male-to-female ratio across all the regions in Kenya is equal. Kenya has 47 diverse counties with different population densities, climatic conditions, economic opportunities, and levels of development. Not surprisingly, we find (Figure 3) that there is a wide range of human sex ratios (90–120 males per 100 females) across the different counties (administrative units).\nFigure 3: Counties in the West of Kenya have higher female-to-male ratios, while counties in the North-East have higher male-female ratios.\nThe highest sex ratio is found in Garissa county (120 males per 100 females), and the lowest is observed in Siaya county (90 males per 100 females). Many counties with low sex ratios (more females) are primarily located in the west of Kenya, and counties with high sex ratios (more males) are found in the north of Kenya. According to the Economic Survey (2022) [^8], male life expectancy in the west of Kenya is the lowest in the country. Homa Bay and Migori recorded a life expectancy of 50.5 years, which was approximately 10 years lower than that of females in the respective counties. This is against a difference of 3 to 5 years lower for males in some of the counties in the north of Kenya.\nWithin each of Kenya’s 47 counties are smaller administrative units known as subcounties. For the final analysis, I thought it would be interesting to see whether the patterns observed at the county level were consistent across the various subcounties.\nFigure 4: Balambala subcounty has the highest female-to-male ratio, while Mandera Central has the lowest.\nHaving just observed that counties in the north of Kenya had the highest number of males per 100 females, I was surprised to find that Mandera Central (Mandera County) and Tarbaj (Wajir County) subcounties in the north were among the subcounties with the lowest number of males per 100 females (Figure 4). Why females tend to concentrate within specific regions in these two counties may be an interesting aspect to investigate in future studies.\nOverall, many factors may affect the human sex ratio at the county and subcounty levels and cause the differences in the human sex ratio seen with age. High rural-urban migration, public health factors (including the prevalence of various communicable and non-communicable diseases), climate, and location’s primary source of employment may skew the number of males to females in certain subcounties. Therefore, future investigations should focus on the causes of these variations in the human sex ratio and the implications for administrative planning at the national, county, and subcounty levels."

Factors\nFactors are used to store integers or strings which are categorical. They categorize data and store the data in different levels. This form of data storage is useful for statistical modeling. Examples include TRUE or FALSE and male or female.\n\nvector &lt;- c(\"Male\", \"Female\")\nfactor_1 &lt;- factor(vector)\nfactor_1\n\n[1] Male   Female\nLevels: Female Male\n\n\nOR\n\nfactor_2 &lt;- as.factor(vector)\nfactor_2\n\n[1] Male   Female\nLevels: Female Male\n\nas.numeric(factor_2)\n\n[1] 2 1"

The deletion of this missing data may lead to bias or data loss, so we need to be very careful when handling it.

    "text": "In this 1st post, the reader will be introduced to the R programming language and RStudio software.\n\n\nThis blog aims to introduce new R/RStudio users to the fundamentals of R and lay the groundwork for more in-depth statistical analysis, data visualization, and reporting methods. I hope to present the topics in a straightforward manner so that anyone new to programming is not intimidated.\n\n\n\nR is a programming language and open-source (freely available) software invented by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman in 1993 (published as open-source in 1995) when they were based at the University of Auckland. Fun fact: R represents the first letter of the first names of the creators. The software is utilized by individuals working for various organizations ranging from academic institutions and healthcare organizations to financial services and information technology companies. In May 2022, the TIOBE index (a measure of programming language popularity) demonstrated that R was the 13th most popular programming language. R’s popularity may result from its highly extensible nature that allows users to perform statistical data analysis, generate visualizations, and report findings.\n\n\nAs mentioned in the previous section, R is an open-source software that is highly extensible. Thousands of extensions (also known as packages) can be installed, allowing one to increase the number of available applications. The main advantages of R include: 1. A large community of users and developers that can provide learning support and assist with technical challenges, 2. The ability to perform reproducible research. 3. Its cross-platform nature, which means that it can be used on Linux, Windows, and Mac operating systems. 4. The ability to generate high-quality graphics from datasets of varying dimensions.\n\n\n\nTo install R on your personal computer, visit The R Project for Statistical Computing’s Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN), download the most recent version, and install it according to the website’s instructions. Once you download R, you can now experiment with some of its features.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The standard R interface (Windows)\nWhen you open R, you will notice that it has a basic graphical user interface (GUI), and the console displays a command-line interface (CLI; where each command is executed one at a time). This may be intimidating for new users; however, there is a workaround for those who are not comfortable working at the command line. For those who are not experienced programmers, R can be used with an application called RStudio.\n\n\n\n\nRStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R that was developed by JJ Allaire. This software contains tools that make programming in R easier. RStudio extends R’s capabilities by making it easier to import data, write scripts, and generate visualizations and reports. The RStudio IDE is available for download from the RStudio website.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: RStudio interface with four main panes (Windows)\nOnce installed, the basic layout of RStudio reveals that there is a script (text editor), console, navigation, and environment/history window pane. The script pane (text editor) in the upper-left allows one to write, open, edit, and execute more extended programs compared with using the standalone R software. The console pane (bottom-left) displays the script’s output and offers a command-line interface for typing code that is immediately executed. The environment pane (upper-right) displays information about the created objects, the history of executed code, and any external connections. Finally, the navigation pane (bottom-right) shows multiple tabs. Its primary tabs include the “Plot” tab, which shows graphics created by code, the “Packages” tab where the packages are installed, and the “Help” tab, which provides assistance for all things R and allows one to search the R documentation.\n\n\nRStudio allows one to create projects (a collection of related files stored within a working directory). Additionally, RStudio can be customized using options available under the “Tools” tab. Lastly, RStudio has Git integration that allows for version control where you can back up your code at different timepoints and effortlessly transfer code between computers.1\n\n\n\n\nHopefully, this was a helpful introduction to R and RStudio. In subsequent blog posts, we will focus on:\n\nPart 1: Simple arithmetic,\nPart 2: Variables,\nPart 3: Data types,\nPart 4: Operators,\nPart 5: Vectors,\nPart 6: Missing data\nPart 7: Data Structures"
