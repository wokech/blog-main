    "text": "In this 1st post, the reader will be introduced to the R programming language and RStudio software.\n\n\nThis blog aims to introduce new R/RStudio users to the fundamentals of R and lay the groundwork for more in-depth statistical analysis, data visualization, and reporting methods. I hope to present the topics in a straightforward manner so that anyone new to programming is not intimidated.\n\n\n\nR is a programming language and open-source (freely available) software invented by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman in 1993 (published as open-source in 1995) when they were based at the University of Auckland. Fun fact: R represents the first letter of the first names of the creators. The software is utilized by individuals working for various organizations ranging from academic institutions and healthcare organizations to financial services and information technology companies. In May 2022, the TIOBE index (a measure of programming language popularity) demonstrated that R was the 13th most popular programming language. R’s popularity may result from its highly extensible nature that allows users to perform statistical data analysis, generate visualizations, and report findings.\n\n\nAs mentioned in the previous section, R is an open-source software that is highly extensible. Thousands of extensions (also known as packages) can be installed, allowing one to increase the number of available applications. The main advantages of R include: 1. A large community of users and developers that can provide learning support and assist with technical challenges, 2. The ability to perform reproducible research. 3. Its cross-platform nature, which means that it can be used on Linux, Windows, and Mac operating systems. 4. The ability to generate high-quality graphics from datasets of varying dimensions.\n\n\n\nTo install R on your personal computer, visit The R Project for Statistical Computing’s Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN), download the most recent version, and install it according to the website’s instructions. Once you download R, you can now experiment with some of its features.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The standard R interface (Windows)\nWhen you open R, you will notice that it has a basic graphical user interface (GUI), and the console displays a command-line interface (CLI; where each command is executed one at a time). This may be intimidating for new users; however, there is a workaround for those who are not comfortable working at the command line. For those who are not experienced programmers, R can be used with an application called RStudio.\n\n\n\n\nRStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R that was developed by JJ Allaire. This software contains tools that make programming in R easier. RStudio extends R’s capabilities by making it easier to import data, write scripts, and generate visualizations and reports. The RStudio IDE is available for download from the RStudio website.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: RStudio interface with four main panes (Windows)\nOnce installed, the basic layout of RStudio reveals that there is a script (text editor), console, navigation, and environment/history window pane. The script pane (text editor) in the upper-left allows one to write, open, edit, and execute more extended programs compared with using the standalone R software. The console pane (bottom-left) displays the script’s output and offers a command-line interface for typing code that is immediately executed. The environment pane (upper-right) displays information about the created objects, the history of executed code, and any external connections. Finally, the navigation pane (bottom-right) shows multiple tabs. Its primary tabs include the “Plot” tab, which shows graphics created by code, the “Packages” tab where the packages are installed, and the “Help” tab, which provides assistance for all things R and allows one to search the R documentation.\n\n\nRStudio allows one to create projects (a collection of related files stored within a working directory). Additionally, RStudio can be customized using options available under the “Tools” tab. Lastly, RStudio has Git integration that allows for version control where you can back up your code at different timepoints and effortlessly transfer code between computers.1\n\n\n\n\nHopefully, this was a helpful introduction to R and RStudio. In subsequent blog posts, we will focus on:\n\nPart 1: Simple arithmetic,\nPart 2: Variables,\nPart 3: Data types,\nPart 4: Operators,\nPart 5: Vectors,\nPart 6: Missing data\nPart 7: Data Structures"

    "title": "Are there more men than women in Kenya?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "To answer this question, I reviewed the Kenya Population and Housing Census (2019)12 report, which provides data on population by sex and age at the county and sub-county levels. This analysis was inspired by Rose Mintzer-Sweeney’s article “Sex and the Census,” published on the Datawrapper website 3.\nVarious biological, cultural, public health, and economic factors can influence the global human sex ratio. For instance, at birth, the human sex ratio is “male-biased,” with approximately 105 males born per 100 girls. However, with increasing age, the susceptibility to infectious diseases, sex-selective abortions, and higher life expectancies for women can cause fluctuations in the human sex ratio4. The total Kenyan population in 2019 (according to the census) was 47,564,296. When I compared the number of males to females at the national level (Figure 1), I found that there were 98 males for every 100 females in the country5.\nKnowing there were more females than males, I sought to determine whether these differences persisted across all age groups (Figure 2).\nAs expected, I observed a higher number of males compared with females between 0 to 18 years. One reason could be the higher male-to-female ratio seen at birth globally6. Between the ages of 19 to 34 years, the male-to-female ratio decreases rapidly, while from 35 to 56 years, the ratio increases rapidly. The cause of this fluctuation is not apparent, but various public health factors may be responsible for the shifts observed within these age groups. Finally, the number of males compared with females steadily decreases after age 60. One reason for this could be the prevalence of medical conditions that disproportionately affect men. Additionally, the decrease in the number of males to females could result from increases in life expectancy favoring women, as demonstrated by the Economic Survey 2022, which shows that the male life expectancy is 60.6 vs. 66.5 for females7.\nBy focusing on the national human sex ratio, we may assume that the male-to-female ratio across all the regions in Kenya is equal. Kenya has 47 diverse counties with different population densities, climatic conditions, economic opportunities, and levels of development. Not surprisingly, we find (Figure 3) that there is a wide range of human sex ratios (90–120 males per 100 females) across the different counties (administrative units).\nThe highest sex ratio is found in Garissa county (120 males per 100 females), and the lowest is observed in Siaya county (90 males per 100 females). Many counties with low sex ratios (more females) are primarily located in the west of Kenya, and counties with high sex ratios (more males) are found in the north of Kenya. According to the Economic Survey (2022) [^8], male life expectancy in the west of Kenya is the lowest in the country. Homa Bay and Migori recorded a life expectancy of 50.5 years, which was approximately 10 years lower than that of females in the respective counties. This is against a difference of 3 to 5 years lower for males in some of the counties in the north of Kenya.\nWithin each of Kenya’s 47 counties are smaller administrative units known as sub-counties. For the final analysis, I thought it would be interesting to see whether the patterns observed at the county level were consistent across the various sub-counties.\nHaving just observed that counties in the north of Kenya had the highest number of males per 100 females, I was surprised to find that Mandera Central (Mandera County) and Tarbaj (Wajir County) sub-counties in the north were among the sub-counties with the lowest number of males per 100 females (Figure 4). Why females tend to concentrate within specific regions in these two counties may be an interesting aspect to investigate in future studies.\nOverall, many factors may affect the human sex ratio at the county and sub-county levels and cause the differences in the human sex ratio seen with age. High rural-urban migration, public health factors (including the prevalence of various communicable and non-communicable diseases), climate, and location’s primary source of employment may skew the number of males to females in certain sub-counties. Therefore, future investigations should focus on the causes of these variations in the human sex ratio and the implications for administrative planning at the national, county, and sub-county levels."

Tabular data has rows representing observations and columns representing variables. Dataframes contain lists of equal-length vectors. Each column holds a different type of data, but within each column, the elements must be of the same type. The most common data frame characteristics are listed below:\n• Columns should have a name;\n• Row names should be unique;\n• Various data can be stored (such as numeric, factor, and character);\n• The individual columns should contain the same number of data items.\n\n\nCreation of data frames\n\nlevel <- c(\"Low\", \"Mid\", \"High\")\nlanguage <- c(\"R\", \"RStudio\", \"Shiny\")\nage <- c(25, 36, 47)\n\ndf_1 <- data.frame(level, language, age)\n\n\n\nFunctions used to manipulate data frames\n\na.

Arrays\nAn array is a multidimensional vector that stores homogeneous data. It can be thought of as a stacked matrix and stores data in more than 2 dimensions (n-dimensional). An array is composed of rows by columns by dimensions. Example: an array with dimensions, dim = c(2,3,3), has 2 rows, 3 columns, and 3 matrices.\n\na. Creating arrays\n\narr_1 <- array(1:12, dim = c(2,3,2))\n\narr_1\n\n, , 1\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3]\n[1,]    1    3    5\n[2,]    2    4    6\n\n, , 2\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3]\n[1,]    7    9   11\n[2,]    8   10   12\n\n\n\n\nb. Filter array by index\n\narr_1[1, , ]\n\n     [,1] [,2]\n[1,]    1    7\n[2,]    3    9\n[3,]    5   11\n\narr_1[1, ,1]\n\n[1] 1 3 5\n\narr_1[, , 1]\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3]\n[1,]    1    3    5\n[2,]    2    4    6\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Factors\nFactors are used to store integers or strings which are categorical. They categorize data and store the data in different levels. This form of data storage is useful for statistical modeling. Examples include TRUE or FALSE and male or female.\n\nvector <- c(\"Male\", \"Female\")\nfactor_1 <- factor(vector)\nfactor_1\n\n[1] Male   Female\nLevels: Female Male\n\n\nOR\n\nfactor_2 <- as.factor(vector)\nfactor_2\n\n[1] Male   Female\nLevels: Female Male\n\nas.numeric(factor_2)\n\n[1] 2 1"

Generally, we can use tools such as mi, mice, and Amelia (which will be discussed later) to deal with missing data. The deletion of this missing data may lead to bias or data loss, so we need to be very careful when handling it. In subsequent blog posts, we will look at the use of imputation to deal with missing data."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nAn aerial view of most settlements in Kenya will demonstrate that many residential home roofs are constructed using iron sheets.\nIndeed, this is confirmed by the Kenya Population and Housing Census (2019) report 1 2 where we see that 4 out of every 5 households (total number = 12,043,016) in Kenya is roofed using iron sheets (Figure 1). Overall, the top 5 building materials are iron sheets (80.3%), concrete (8.2%), grass/twigs (5.1%), makuti (sun-dried coconut palm leaves; 1.6%), and asbestos (1.4%). Despite the widespread use of iron sheets, it is surprising to note that 1.4% (2.2% urban and 0.9% rural) of residential household roofs (which is approximately 170,000) are covered with asbestos-based roofing materials (NB: this figure does not include public buildings such as educational institutions and government facilities).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Roof types in Kenya (visualizations generated in RStudio)\n\n\nAsbestos and its potential risks\nAsbestos refers to a class of six minerals that naturally form a bundle of fibers. These fibers have many properties that make them attractive, including a lack of electrical conductivity, and chemical, heat, and fire resistance. Historically, asbestos has been used for various commercial and industrial applications, including roofing shingles, automobile brakes, and textured paints for walls and ceilings 3. However, using asbestos for products that come into regular contact with humans is quite problematic. Why? Asbestos is a known human carcinogen, and the primary risk factor for most mesotheliomas is asbestos exposure 4 5. Furthermore, asbestos exposure (depending on the frequency, amount, and type) can cause asbestosis, pleural disease, and cancer. If asbestos-based materials remain intact, there is minimal risk to the user, but if materials are damaged via natural degradation or during home demolition and remodeling, tiny asbestos fibers will be released into the air 6 7. In Kenya, Legal Notice No. 121 of the Environmental Management and Coordination (Waste Management) Regulations (2006)8 states that waste containing asbestos is classified as hazardous. Why should Kenyans be concerned about this? In the 2013/2014 financial year, Kenya spent approximately one-tenth of its total health budget on asbestos-related cancers 9 10 11.\nWhere do we find high numbers of asbestos-based roofs in Kenya? As previously stated, 1.4% of households in Kenya have asbestos-based roofs. Figure 2 demonstrates the percentage of households with asbestos-based roofs in every county in Kenya. Interestingly, 4 (Nairobi, Kajiado, Machakos, and Kiambu) out of the top 6 counties (from a total of 47) fall within the Nairobi Metropolitan region.\n\n\nWhere do we find high numbers of asbestos-based roofs in Kenya?\nAs previously stated, 1.4% of households in Kenya have asbestos-based roofs. Figure 2 demonstrates the percentage of households with asbestos-based roofs in every county in Kenya. Interestingly, 4 (Nairobi, Kajiado, Machakos, and Kiambu) out of the top 6 counties (from a total of 47) fall within the Nairobi Metropolitan region.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Percentage(%) of households with asbestos-based roofs distributed by county (visualizations generated using RStudio)\nNext, I investigated the subcounties with the highest number of households with asbestos-based roofs. The top 5 subcounties are located within Nairobi county, with Embakasi subcounty taking the lead with just over 8,000 households.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: The top ten subcounties with the highest number of households that have asbestos-based roofs (visualizations generated using RStudio)\n\n\nConclusion\nOverall, this study demonstrates that a notable proportion of Kenyan households used asbestos-based roofing materials, with Nairobi Metropolitan county accounting for the largest number of households. It is widely acknowledged that asbestos is harmful to our health, and asbestos-related diseases impose a significant burden on the economy. However, the impact of these roofs on the health of residents may not be fully apparent as asbestos exposure may also occur in various settings such as educational facilities and government institutions. To lessen the impact of asbestos exposure, it would be beneficial for local/county governments to educate residents about the dangers of asbestos and facilitate the complex and costly removal of asbestos-based roofing materials.\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nKenya National Bureau of Statistics.
